Currently I'm working in Whitneyâ€˜s Lab, UC Berkeley as Rearch Assistant, working with [Dr. Zhihang Ren](https://albuspeter.github.io/) under the supervision of Prof. David Whitney and Prof Stella Yu. I'm also working with Prof. Chuang Gan. My research interests are mainly Computer Vision, Machine Learning and the integration with Cognitive Science.
