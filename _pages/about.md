I am a senior undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech and a Exchange Student in UC Berkeley. Currently I'm working in Whitneyâ€˜s Lab, UC Berkeley as Rearch Assistant under the supervision of Prof. David Whitney and Prof Stella Yu. I'm also working with Prof. Chuang Gan. My research interests are mainly Computer Vision, Machine Learning and the integration with Cognitive Science.  My current work is mainly focusing on the:
   1. Integrating generative model with object detection, tracking and motion detection
